# NFT

Royalties based NFT smart contract using Solidity on Polygon.

I created a Solidity ERC721 contract that supports secondary sales royalties. This contract will allow you to create NFT tokens, post them for sale on different exchanges and allow the contract owner to claim a creator royalty on each secondary sale.
